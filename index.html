      <p>This is a Clojure REPL applet written by <a href="http://github.com/Raynes">Anthony Simpson</a>
        using Beanshell's JConsole Swing component.</p>
      <p>Chances are, you'll get a weird permission error when this applet tries to run. The only way
        that I know how to fix this right now is to put this in ~/.java.policy:</p>
      <pre>grant {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};</pre>
      <p>This is likely unsafe to have around <i>all</i> the time, but for the purposes of a web REPL,
        I suppose it's reasonable. If anybody else knows how to fix it without granting such daunting
        permissions, feel free to contact me via email or github (linked above).
      </p>
      <p>Also, if you haven't noticed already, this REPL is absolutely <b>not</b> sandboxed, so don't be silly.
        It's your machine you'll screw up, not mine. :p</p>
