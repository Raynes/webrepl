# webrepl

This is just a simple REPL applet that uses Beanshell's JConsole component (at least for now). It's pretty basic right now, and looks like clj-swingrepl.

The primary reason for this project is so that I can focus on making try-clojure a learning thing rather than an all purpose web REPL for everybody. People tend to complain about try-clojure's sandboxing (which certainly isn't perfect, but mostly does the trick), and this is for those people. It's an applet, so sandboxing is not needed.
